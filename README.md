# Magic Square Game

The Magic Square Game is a Java-based desktop application developed using Swing. It generates a magic square of a specified odd dimension and shuffles it for the user to solve. The goal of the game is to rearrange the shuffled magic square back into its original form where the sum of numbers in each row, column, and diagonal are equal.

## Features

- **Dynamic Matrix Generation**: Users can input any odd number greater than 1 to generate a magic square of that dimension.
- **Interactive Gameplay**: Users can click and swap adjacent cells to solve the magic square.
- **Difficulty Adjustment**: After solving a magic square, the game increases the difficulty by generating a larger matrix.
- **Completion Validation**: The game checks if the user's solution is a valid magic square regardless of the initial configuration.
- **Timer and Score**: The game tracks the time taken to solve the magic square.

## Technologies Used

- **Java Swing**: For the graphical user interface.
- **Java AWT**: For event handling and graphics.

## How to Play

1. Enter an odd number greater than 1 to generate a magic square.
2. Click on a cell to select it, then click on an adjacent cell to swap them.
3. Continue swapping until the magic square is correctly solved.
4. Submit your time and challenge yourself with increasing difficulty levels.
